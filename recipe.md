Step 1:
Heat oven to 190C / 170C fan/gas 5. Butter the base and sides of two 20cm round sandwich tins 
and line the bases with baking parchment.

Step 2:
In a large bowl, beat together 200g Golden caster sugar, 200g softened unsalted butter, 4 large eggs,
200g self-raising flour, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 2 tbsp
milk and a pinch of salt until pale.

Step 3:
Divide the mixture between the prepared tins. Bake for 20 mins or until a skewer inserted into the
centre of the cake comes out clean.

Step 4:
Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
